### Why VegTrack360?  
Monitoring outdoor spaces effectively is a complex challenge. Traditional fixed cameras, like the [PhenoCam](https://phenocam.nau.edu/webcam/), offer limited perspectives, capturing only a single angle of a diverse and dynamic scene. To achieve a comprehensive 360-degree view, multiple cameras are typically required. While this setup is feasible with standard RGB cameras, it becomes prohibitively expensive when incorporating advanced sensors such as thermal cameras or spectrometers.

### The Solution  
VegTrack360 addresses this challenge with a simple yet powerful rotating camera platform. By utilizing a single camera mounted on a rotating mechanism, the system creates seamless 360-degree panoramic images, offering a comprehensive view at a fraction of the cost. Whether you’re monitoring a backyard garden, a sprawling agricultural field, or a wildlife habitat, VegTrack360 delivers versatile and cost-effective imaging capabilities.

### Additional Features
The VegTrack360 offers a simple GUI. After connecting to a computer or smartphone via WiFi, users can simply program the camera and start the image taking process:

VegTrack360 takes panoramic imaging a step further by enabling the re-projection of panoramic images into drone-style orthomosaics. This feature transforms panoramic views into practical, top-down representations of the monitored area, offering deeper insights into spatial patterns.
